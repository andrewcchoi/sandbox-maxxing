## Purpose

Version-specific documentation is archived here to:
- Keep the main docs/ directory focused on current version documentation
- Preserve historical context for major architectural changes
- Provide reference for users still on older versions

## Maintenance

When archiving new documents:
1. Use version number in filename (e.g., `FEATURE-v4.x.x.md`)
2. Add entry to this README with brief description
3. Remove links from main documentation
